# Python-Automated-Game-Player
This is a simple demonestration of openCV color segmentation project. I used openCV, win32gui, win32api and PIL to develop this program and you have to install them using pip or any prefered ways before running this program.

Make sure that you have opened your chrome browser browser and set the url <em>chrome://dino</em> before running the program. Make sure your chrome is not full screen to see the progress of the program through it's display screen.
The code is well commented. Fork the code, make your own change and let me know.

Have fun!
